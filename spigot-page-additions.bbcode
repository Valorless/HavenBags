#FAQ

[SPOILER="How can i edit bag data on SQLite?"]
In order to load and edit the .db file, you need a program called "DB Browser (SQLite)".
Here's how to get it: [URL]https://sqlitebrowser.org[/URL]

Disclaimer: Shut down the plugin (or server,) before editing the database.
If you're not hosting the server locally, you'll have to download the database file.
